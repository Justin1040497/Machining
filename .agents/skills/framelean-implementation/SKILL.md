# FrameLean Implementation

Read `.agents/skills/README.md` and the accepted requirement or plan. Inspect related implementation and tests before editing.

## Rules

- Make the smallest coherent change that completes the confirmed scope.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and avoid formatting churn, duplicate abstractions, speculative features, and unnecessary dependencies.
- Prefer existing helpers, providers, use cases, mappers, widgets, scripts, and documentation patterns.
- Keep `domain` independent of Flutter, Drift, FFmpeg, filesystem, and platform APIs; keep orchestration in `application`, implementations in `infrastructure`, UI coordination in `features`, and composition / shared presentation in `app`.
- Update only documentation whose current facts changed. Keep temporary plans in `.workspace/`.
- If evidence invalidates the agreed scope or exposes a material risk, stop and explain before expanding the task.

After editing, inspect the diff and run proportionate checks for the changed surface. Use `framelean-validation` for deep review, broad suites, or validation-specific work.

Report what changed, the boundary it satisfies, relevant behavior deliberately left unchanged, checks run, and remaining risks.
