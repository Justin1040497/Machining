# FrameLean Validation

Read `.agents/skills/README.md`. Inspect Git status and the relevant diff before selecting checks.

Review for scope creep, architecture violations, missing behavior coverage, stale facts, broken runtime or platform assumptions, and unrelated user changes. Run targeted checks first, then broaden according to risk.

For changed Dart files, check formatting without modifying files:

```bash
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed <changed-dart-files>
flutter analyze
flutter test <targeted-tests>
```

Run the full Flutter suite only when the changed surface or requested confidence justifies it.

For docs or project Skills:

```bash
git diff --check
python3 <current-skill-creator>/scripts/quick_validate.py .agents/skills/framelean-skill-name
```

Resolve the available system `skill-creator` from the current environment; do not embed a user-specific absolute path. If its Python validator cannot import YAML, use another structured YAML parser and report the fallback. Scan for stale paths and deleted names with `rg`.

Report the checked scope, commands and concrete results, actionable findings, and risks not covered. Never claim a check passed unless it ran successfully.
